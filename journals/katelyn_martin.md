Week 1: project brainstorming. Started with toy trading app ideas, however, we realized setting up an ecommerce site was a bit beyond our capabilities/time frame for this project. We have started with a new idea: ParkIt (crowd-sourced parking spot finder app). Ended the week with finding our API, Bing Maps API, that we will use to populate a list of local public parking areas based on user location.
Week 2:
## 11/14/22
Today, I worked on:
* Restructuring wireframe and logo creation

We worked together as a group to finalize our wireframe design for our ParkIt idea. We also collaborated together to create our porducts logo.

## 11/15/22
Today, I worked on:
* API endpoint design:

I worked with Kaludia and Andrew to determine our API endpoint design for the login, signup, main page, parking spot submission form, and partially through our parking list view/map. We are having a hard time to fully visualize how our backend code will be at this moment with our calls to third-party APIs.

We also presented our idea to the group today with good feedback!

## 11/16/22
Today, I worked on:
* posgres database set up, API endpoint design, docker yaml file updates

I set up our project database using postgresql. I also updated our yaml file to support this updates throughout the project. I worked with Klaudia to finalize API endpoint design. We do realize that these endpoints can change as the project evolves. I uploaded the wireframe and created the api.md in docs. I am currently debating between setting up a script to set up our database tables vs using migrations.

## 11/17/22
Today, I worked on:
* progres database set up, authentication, log in, log out.

I ended up reconfiguring our postgres set up to use migrations instead of a sql file. I learned about using the F2 key today from the video on authentication in order to select all items on a page. Worked for a long time with Klaudia to get authentication set up. Had some issues when it came to our Account Repo.

## 11/18/22
Today, I worked on:
* Authentication. Third party API manipulation.

The lecture this morning was very enlightening. I was able to get our authetication, log in, log out working from the lecture Dalonte gave! We are now working on deciding how to save our user input addresses in the back end in order to populate them on our dynamic map on the front end.
